    <!--Today I will show you the most important HTML
    layout tags you will use inside the <body>,
    such as <header>, <main>, <nav>, and others.
    -->
    <header>
        <!--<header> is a semantic HTML tag used for the top part of a page or a section.
        It usually contains the main title (like an <h1>), a logo, navigation links (<nav>),
        and sometimes a short intro or search bar.
        Key points:
        • It helps organize the page structure and makes your HTML easier to understand.
        • You can have more than one <header> on a page (for example, one for the whole site and another inside an <article> or<section>).
        • <header> does not have to be only at the very top of the page, but it usually is.
        -->
        <h1>Website Title</h1><!--<h1> is the main heading of a page. It tells the user (and the browser) what the page is mainly about.-->
        <nav>
            <!--<nav> is a semantic tag for navigation.
            It wraps the main menu links that help
            users move around the site, like “Home”, “About”, “Contact”.-->
            <a href="#">Home</a>
            <a href="#">About Us</a>
            <a href="#">Contacts</a>
        </nav>
    </header>

    <main>
     <!--<main> is the semantic tag for the main content of
     the page — the part that is unique and most important. 
     It usually holds what the user came to see
     (articles, content blocks, product lists, etc.).
     A page should normally have only one <main> element.

     Inside <main>: <section>, <h2>, <p>,<section>
     A <section> is a thematic block of content. 
     Use it when you have a clear “topic” or “part” of the page. A section usually includes a heading.

     <h2>
     <h2> is a second-level heading. It names a section and helps build a clean structure:
     h1 = page title, h2 = section titles, h3 = smaller subsections.

     <p>
     <p> is a paragraph for normal text, descriptions, explanations, etc.-->
        <section>
            <h2>Section 1</h2>
            <p>Section text.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Section 2</h2>
            <p>More text.</p>
        </section>
    </main>

    <footer>
        <!--<footer> is the bottom part of a page
        (or the bottom of a section/article).
        It usually contains extra information such as copyright,
        contacts, social links, legal links, or navigation. Like <header>,
        you can have more than one footer if you use it inside specific blocks,
        but most pages have one main footer at the bottom.-->
