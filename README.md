Lesson #1 — The “Brain” of an HTML page
In this lesson, I built a basic HTML5 page skeleton and explained what each part does. We added the <!DOCTYPE html> declaration, set the page language with <html lang="en">, and configured the <head> section: UTF-8 encoding, the responsive viewport meta tag, the tab title via <title>, and a short SEO description using <meta name="description">. I also demonstrated how to link external resources: a local CSS file (styles.css), a local JavaScript file (app.js using defer), a favicon, and how to include libraries via CDN links (Bootstrap CSS and Bootstrap JS bundle). The <body> is left empty for now — it will hold the visible page content in the next lesson.

Lesson #1.1 — <body>...</body>
